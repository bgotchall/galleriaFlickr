This repo is for a pretty dirty workspace where I am trying to get the Gallery and Flickr integration working

Steps taken:  First I got a basic Galleria working, from local Galleria directories, and local photos.  Folio fiew works fine


Next step:  was trying to get the flickr-sdk module examples working.  failing miserably.  the examples are not incluseive and I am missing something
